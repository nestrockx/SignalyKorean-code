## My Android app for learning the Korean alphabet and Korean pronunciation.

In designing it, I paid attention to make user engagement as high as possible.  
Two of the main functionalities are based on activities essential to language learning: writing and speaking.  
I tried to make the interaction as natural as possible and induce a feeling of satisfaction,  
so that the user would want to use the application and achieve the desired learning results.  
To achieve my goal, I programmed a system that checks whether the sign drawn by the user  
coincides with the character given in the example and I implemented the shapes of all the characters of the Korean Hangul alphabet.

This system allows you to quickly learn the characters and test your acquired Korean handwriting skills.  
The second functionality encourages you to say the given words, which helps you remember them.  
In addition, thanks to the speech recognition service from Google, the application shows the level of confidence that the given word was spoken correctly, allowing you to improve your pronunciation.
